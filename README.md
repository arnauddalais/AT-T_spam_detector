Subject :

One of the main pain point that AT\&T users are facing is constant exposure to SPAM messages.

AT\&T has been able to manually flag spam messages for a time, but they are looking for an automated way of detecting spams to protect their users.

Deliverable:
AT&T_spam_detector.ipynb is for the first model (RNN with LSTM)
AT&T_spam_detector_new_model.ipynb is for a second step with pretrained model and best result
